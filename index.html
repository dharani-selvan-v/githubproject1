                        Amarendra's love story with Devasena, a princess of the Kuntala kingdom
                        Bhallaladeva asking for Devasena's hand in marriage, which drives a wedge between Amarendra and Sivagami
                        Sivagami forcing Amarendra to choose between the throne and Devasena
                        Amarendra and Devasena being banished from the palace
                        Bhallaladeva using large fleets to fight Baahubali
                        Devasena burning Bhallaladeva alive 
                        The movie was co-written and directed by S. S. Rajamouli and was originally made in Telugu and Tamil, but was also dubbed into other languages. Some say the movie has an infectious sense of momentum, inspiring characters, and physics-defying choreography. Others praise the emotional drama of the scenes leading up to Kattapa killing Baahubali.
